# Branch-Prediction-Decision-Trees


### Abstract

Branch prediction is a technique used in CPU design that attempts to guess the outcome of a conditional operation and prepare for the most likely result. A digital circuit that performs this operation is known as a branch predictor. It is an important component of modern CPU architectures, such as the x86.

In this work, the problem of branch prediction is treated as a binary classification problem. I use an off-line training methods such as Decision Trees, Random Forest and MLP to compare them with current SOTA - TAGE predictor.
